# Config for Android

Config 1, 2 and 3 has reflections, it's disabled on Config 4 and 5.

Recommended to use the configs with FSR and Anti-Aliasing On in settings.

To disable post processing effects you can use the same file for PC that's in the [Common](https://github.com/AlteriaX/WuWa-Configs/tree/main/Common) folder. I don't like playing games on phone so these are configs that are done quickly with minimal testing, won't do image comparisons or update as often.

On newer Android versions you need to use Shizuku to access the data folder, won't write a guide for this so do a Google search about it.
