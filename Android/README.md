# Config for Android

Recommended to use the configs with Anti-Aliasing On in settings.

I don't like playing games on phone so these are configs that are done quickly with minimal testing, won't update it as often.

On newer Android versions you need to use Shizuku to access the data folder, won't write a guide for this so do a Google search about it.
