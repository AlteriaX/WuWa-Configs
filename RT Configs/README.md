**RT Global Illumination** - Each preset same as in-game but with less ghosting

**RT Reflections** - Slightly lower FPS due to increasing smooth bias on all preset, read the information inside file

**RT Shadows** - No changes

RT Ultra is more demanding compared to default RT High, only use if you have RTX 4090/5090 or don't need extra FPS
